<h2 align="center">Concept Idea</h2>
<p align="center">
  I always found that creating some sort of consistency in my life to be somewhat of a challenge. Especially with forming habits like waking up early, making sure I'm drinking enough water, consuming a decent diet, achieving my study goals, spending enough time with friends & family... The list goes on. I have found that using multiple applications to try and build multiple different habits (i.e. a journal for journaling habit, a water reminder app to remind me to drink water, a to-do list app for my daily to-do) was a hassle. I thought it would be great to be able to pile all of those applications into a simple "Life Hub", meaning everything that I need to access is all in one place. No need to go from application to application - they're all in front of me.
